<h1 id="a.-discourse-relations">A. Discourse Relations</h1>
<p>The annotation of discourse relations adopts a different format and
is thus described in an appendix to the AURIS guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Discourse relations</strong> or <strong>coherence
relations</strong> represent relations that describe the semantic or
pragmatic relation utterances in a discourse. They are an important
device in the establishment of coherence in text comprehension, and are
thus often (but not always) signalled by means of language specific
cues, or discourse markers, e.g., conjunctions, adverbials and particles
such as <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>but</em> or <em>then</em>. A
speaker can use discourse markers to explicate a discourse relation to
the addressee, or to assert a discourse relation that would contradict
the addressee’s intuitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Peter pushed Jim. He stumbled.</em> (CAUSAL?)</li>
<li><em>Peter pushed Jim, because he(=Peter) stumbled.</em> (CAUSAL:
reason)</li>
<li><em>Peter pushed Jim. As a result, he(=Jim) stumbled.</em> (CAUSAL:
result)</li>
<li><em>Peter pushed Jim. Then, he(=Peter) stumbled.</em> (TEMPORAL, not
CAUSAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, it is assumed that discourse relations closely interact with
the hierarchical organization of discourse, by establishing larger
discourse segments (discourse units) that span multiple sentences which
are then further connected by means of discourse relations with other
discourse segments to constitute a coherent text. So far, AURIS remains
agnostic about the <em>hierarchical</em> organization of discourse.
Instead, we follow the approach of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB,
Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007) and provide <em>shallow</em> discourse annotations
only. Our guidelines are based on a synthesis of PDTB and ISO 24617-8
guidelines, so that existing PDTB-style annotations (as available for
many languages), resp., discourse annotations in general (which have a
ISO 24617-8 interpretation), can be mapped to AURIS.</p>
<p>We annotate discourse relations between sentences and thus annotate
entire sentences, only. For this reason, manual discourse annotation is
conducted on a different format, but using the same set of technologies
(i.e., Spreadsheet Software).</p>
<p>Although complete sentences are the unit of annotation, the sentence
may include material not relevant for the discourse relation at hand.
Instead, annotators should focus on the main clause of the sentence.
There is an exception for attribution verbs, for which the main clause
of the attributed statement (i.e., the reported speech) is to be
annotated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that these guidelines are partially based on the Penn Discourse
Treebank, which also accounts for intrasentential discourse relations.
We thus still include examples of intrasentential relations in the
definition of discourse relations. In the future, these are to be
replaced by real-world intersentential corpus examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Goal of the annotation is to annotate every sentence with one
<strong>discourse relation</strong>. It is neither required nor expected
that the annotation of discourse relations leads to a tree structure.
The refer to the sentence that is annotated as the
<strong>utterance</strong>, the sentence that it is linked to by the
discourse relation as the <strong>(contextual) anchor</strong>. If a
discourse relation is indicated by an explicit discourse marker, this is
syntactically integrated with the utterance. Accordingly, the
applicability of a discourse relation can be tested by means of a
paraphrase or substitution test where a diagnostic discourse marker is
inserted: If the insertion of a diagnostic discourse marker does not
change the meaning of the utterance in its context, the corresponding
discourse relation can be annotated. A list of diagnostic markers is
provided in an appendix.</p>
<p>The order of anchor and utterance is flexible, but in many cases, the
anchor precedes the utterance. For implicit discourse markers, the
anchor should generally precede the utterance, explicit discourse can be
used by the speaker to underline that the anchor follows the utterance.
A notable special case is the first part of a paired discourse marker,
such as <em>On the one hand … . On the other hand …</em>. Here, the
first utterance, marked with <em>on the one hand</em>, takes the second
as its anchor, whereas the second takes the first as its anchor. If an
utterance carries more than one explicit discourse marker, we annotate
the first discourse marker, only.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section is concerned with the annotation
of discourse relations, i.e., semantic or functional relations between
utterances. As for relations between discourse referents (coreference,
Centering Transitions), this is subject to Sect. 5 of the AURIS
guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="a.1-preparation-and-format">A.1 Preparation and Format</h2>
<p>Annotation is done using Spreadsheet software such as MS Excel or
LibreOffice. We provide automated pre-annotations as well as formulas to
dynamically populate the spreadsheet file. For annotating a file with
pre-annotations, say <code>doyle_bask.14.tsv</code>, please proceed as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy <code>discourse-template.xlsx</code> to
<code>doyle_bask.14.xlsx</code> (take the name of your source file as a
basis)</li>
<li>Open <code>doyle_bask.14.tsv</code> in your Spreadsheet software
(or, alternatively, in a text editor)</li>
<li>Select the full content of <code>doyle_bask.14.tsv</code>
<ul>
<li>Text editor, Windows/Linux: press <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;+A</code> to
select all</li>
<li>Spreadsheet software, Windows/Linux: go to upper left corner (cell
<code>A1</code>), press
<code>&lt;SHIFT&gt;+&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;END&gt;</code> to select table
data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Copy the content of <code>doyle_bask.14.tsv</code>
<ul>
<li>Windows/Linux: press <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;+C</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open <code>doyle_bask.14.xlsx</code> in your Spreadsheet
software</li>
<li>Go to cell <code>A3</code> (first cell, third line)</li>
<li>Paste the content of <code>doyle_bask.14.tsv</code> into
<code>doyle_bask.14.xlsx</code>
<ul>
<li>Windows/Linux: press <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;+V</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Copy the formulas (colored cells) from row <code>3</code>
<ul>
<li>Windows/Linux: nagivate to <code>G3</code>, press
<code>&lt;SHIFT&gt;+&lt;END&gt;</code> to select all formulas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select from <code>G3</code> until the end of the table
<ul>
<li>Windows/Linux: navigate to <code>G3</code>, press
<code>&lt;SHIFT&gt;+&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;END&gt;</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paste formulas into the selected area, confirm consent to overwrite
<ul>
<li>Windows/Linux: press <code>&lt;CTRL&gt;+V</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If successful, the entire table should have the same colored columns
as the template.</li>
</ol>
<p>After preparation, your table should look as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img src="discourse-Dateien/template.png" alt="template.png">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">template.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(Note that you can resize column width and height as needed.)</p>
<p>Empty cells should be filled with <code>_</code>, automated
pre-annotations are marked with question marks. After annotations, no
question marks should remain.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet file contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ID</code> (col A) sentence number</li>
<li><code>PREDICATE</code> (col D) main verb, automatically
annotated</li>
<li><code>TEXT</code> (col E) utterance to be annotated</li>
<li><code>MARKER</code> (col G) possible discourse marker. Automatically
identified discourse markers are marked by a question mark. To be
replaced with actual discourse marker (without question mark).</li>
<li><code>TARGET</code> (col H) ID of the utterance that serves as
anchor of the discourse relation.</li>
<li><code>RELATION</code> (col I) discourse relation</li>
<li><code>COMMENT</code> (col J) free-text comment</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in the template, several columns are hidden. These are
auxiliary columns that annotators don’t need to look into.</p>
<p>Also note that automated pre-annotations might be incorrect. Except
for <code>MARKER</code> (whose annotations should be replaced anyway),
correcting an incorrect pre-annotation requires to leave a comment,
either in an accompanying text file (annotation log), with reference to
the corresponding sentence ID, or in the <code>COMMENT</code>
column.</p>
<h2 id="a.2-annotation-tasks-and-procedure">A.2 Annotation Tasks and
Procedure</h2>
<p>Annotation involves the following sub-tasks. Some of these tasks are
automated, however, automated annotations, if found to be incorrect,
should be corrected. In those cases, leave a comment in the
<code>COMMENT</code> column.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For every sentence, identify the main predicate
<ul>
<li>Pre-annotation in <code>PREDICATE</code>. If the annotator believes
the predicate to be incorrect, fix that column and leave a comment with
an explanation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For every sentence, identify the primary discourse marker
(pre-annotation in <code>MARKER</code>)
<ul>
<li>Pre-annotation in <code>MARKER</code>. Should be manually confirmed
or revised.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if there is an explicit discourse marker:
<ol type="1">
<li>annotate the anchor of the discourse relation (i.e., the sentence it
refers to) in column <code>TARGET</code>, identified by its numerical
ID. If there are multiple candidate anchors, annotate the closest
anchor.</li>
<li>annotate the discourse relation in <code>RELATION</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li>if there is no explicit discourse marker:
<ol type="1">
<li>the preceding target candidate is the (main predicate of the)
preceding sentence.</li>
<li>check whether the preceding target candidate is the target of a
discourse relation with the (main predicate of the) preceding clause by
asking yourself the following questions:
<ol type="1">
<li>is there a logical connection between these utterances that could be
described in terms of a discourse relation?</li>
<li>Is there an discourse marker <em>at the current utterance</em> that
could be used to make this explicit? Annotate this discourse marker in
<code>MARKER</code>, put it in round brackets to mark it as an implicit
discourse marker.</li>
<li>If a discourse relation (and, optionally, an implicit
<code>MARKER</code>) has been confirmed, annotate the
<code>TARGET</code> and the <code>RELATION</code>; continue in 5.</li>
<li>If no discourse relation could be annotated, check the following
utterance as candidate anchor, then extend further into preceding
context until an anchor has been found or it can be assumed that no
anchor exists. If the latter, explain why you think so in
<code>COMMENT</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>use the <code>COMMENT</code> column to provide additional comments,
e.g., if no target and/or discourse relation could be established.</li>
<li>continue with the next sentence.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, it seems most practical
to answer these questions in tandem, i.e., to check first which
discourse marker could be applied without having the text sounding
unnatural and then identify the corresponding discourse relation on that
basis. Inserting (or paraphrasing with) diagnosting discourse markers is
an established technique for testing the applicability of a discourse
relation. See Sect. A.4.2 for more detailed instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a.3-identifying-the-main-predicate">A.3 Identifying the Main
Predicate</h2>
<p>For every sentence, we annotate the discourse relations of its core
statement. Syntactically, the core statement is represented by the main
predicate and its syntactic dependents. The main predicate is identified
by the following rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>By default, the main predicate is the syntactic head of the first
main clause in the current sentence</li>
<li>If the syntactic head is a nominal, adjectival or adverbial
predicate of a copula clause with an explicit verb, the predicate
consists of the copula in conjunction with the predicate.</li>
<li>If the syntactic head is an attribution verb (<em>say</em>,
<em>write</em>, <em>think</em>, etc.) and the current sentence contains
a reported statement (direct or indirect speech), the main predicate of
the sentence is the main predicate of the reported statement.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: For syntactic analysis, we expect
pre-annotation in accordance with Universal Dependencies 2.x. See <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/syntax.html">there</a>
for the definition of syntactic heads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rule 3 is designed to rule out verbs of attribution as main
predicates. Here, we follow ISO 24617-8 in excluding them from discourse
annotation (if the sentence contains a reported statement). In (1), the
discourse relation doesn’t hold between the communication acts
(<em>Mr.&nbsp;Edelman said X. Mr.&nbsp;Ackerman contended Y.</em>) but between
their respective statements (<em>X, [implicit:Concession] Y</em>). The
respective main predicates are marked:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li><em>[Mr.&nbsp;Edelman said]<sub>ATTRIBUTION</sub> the decision
”[<strong>has nothing to do</strong>]<sub>PRED</sub> with Marty
Ackerman.” [Mr.&nbsp;Ackerman contended]<sub>ATTRIBUTION</sub> that it
[<strong>was a direct response</strong>]<sub>PRED</sub> to his efforts
to gain control of Datapoint.</em> (PDTB3, wsj 0333)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a.4-annotating-discourse-markers">A.4 Annotating Discourse
Markers</h2>
<p>Discourse markers are cues that overtly mark discourse relations. For
English, this primarily includes</p>
<ul>
<li>adverbials (ADVP and PP, e.g., <em>however</em>, <em>otherwise</em>,
<em>then</em>, <em>as a result</em>, <em>for example</em>),</li>
<li>coordinating conjunctions (e.g., <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>,
<em>nor</em>), and</li>
<li>subordinating conjunctions (e.g., <em>because</em>, <em>when</em>,
<em>since</em>, <em>although</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We distinguish three kinds of discourse markers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit discourse markers are stated in the text. Annotators should
write them as plain strings.</li>
<li>Alternative lexicalizations are phrasal expressions that convey the
same meaning as a discourse marker and that could be paraphrased by a
discourse marker. They are, however, not grammaticalized as discourse
markers. Annotators should write these phrases as plain strings, and add
a discourse marker that could be used as paraphrase after that in square
brackets.</li>
<li>Implicit discourse markers are not stated in the text. Annotators
should write them in round brackets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a.4.1-annotating-explicit-discourse-markers">A.4.1 Annotating
Explicit Discourse Markers</h3>
<p>Explicit discourse markers are drawn from the following grammatical
classes (Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>adverbials (ADVP and PP):</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li><em>The magazine Success, <strong>however</strong>, was for years
lackluster and unfocused.</em> (PDTB2, 1903)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="1">
<li><em><strong>As a result</strong>, industry operated out of small,
expensive, highly inefficient industrial units.</em> (PDTB2, 0629)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>DO NOT ANNOTATE adverbials modifying clauses other than the main
predicate. In line with Universal Dependency syntax, the clause
connected with the conjunction <em>and</em> in (4) is syntactically
analyzed as a dependent of the first clause. It does thus not carry the
main predicate and neither <em>and</em> nor <em>as a result</em> should
be annotated.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="4" type="1">
<li><em>Polyvinyl chloride capacity “has overtaken demand
<strong>and</strong> we are experiencing reduced profit margins
<strong>as a result</strong>”, …</em> (PDTB2, 2083)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>coordinating conjunctions, but only if attached to the main
predicate of an utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="5" type="1">
<li><em>Only 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export
orders in October, down from 27% in September. <strong>And</strong> 8%
said export orders were down last month, compared with 6% the month
before.</em> (PDTB2, 0036)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>DO NOT ANNOTATE conjunctions not modifying the main
predicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="6" type="1">
<li><em>The House has voted to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion,
<strong>but</strong> the Senate isn’t expected to act until next week at
the earliest.</em> (PDTB2, 0008)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="7" type="1">
<li><em>More common chrysotile fibers are curly <strong>and</strong> are
more easily rejected by the body, Dr.&nbsp;Mossman explained.</em> (PDTB2,
0003)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>subordinating conjunctions, but only if attached to the main
predicate of an utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="8" type="1">
<li><em>Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic
cycles? <strong>Because</strong> real-estate purchases and leases are
such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals
make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability
and growth.</em> (PDTB2, 2444)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>DO NOT ANNOTATE conjunctions not modifying the main
predicate:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="9" type="1">
<li><em><strong>Since</strong> McDonald’s menu prices rose this year,
the actual decline may have been more.</em> (PDTB2, 1280, conjunction of
a pre-posed dependent clause)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="10" type="1">
<li><em>The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds
<strong>because</strong> Congress hasn’t lifted the ceiling on
government debt.</em> (PDTB2, 0008, conjunction of a post-posed
dependent clause)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the main predicate carries more than one discourse marker,
annotate the first discourse marker, only:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="11" type="1">
<li><em>Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true:
more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance, initially at least.
<strong>But</strong> then they wake up to a nightmare.</em> (PDTB3, wsj
0518; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019b)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Here the, <em>but</em> and <em>then</em> encode independent discourse
relations, the first indicating Concession, the second a temporal
relation. However, <em>but then</em> can also be analyzed as a single
discourse marker, indicating Concession:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="12" type="1">
<li><em>To many, it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural
judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern Allegheny
Mountains. <strong>But then</strong> Judge O’Kicki often behaved like a
man who would be king – and, some say, an arrogant and abusive one.</em>
(PDTB3, wsj 0267; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019b)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the first discourse marker may also occur at medial (or
final) positions within a clause:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="13" type="1">
<li><em>The Ministry of Finance, <strong>as a result</strong>, has
proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in
real estate …</em> (PDTB2, 0761, medial discourse marker)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Adverbials should be annotated as discourse markers only if they
establish a relation between utterance and anchor. Interjections such as
<em>well</em>, focus markers such as <em>anyway</em>, and clausal
adverbials such as <em>strangely</em>, <em>probably</em>,
<em>frankly</em>, <em>in all likelihood</em> etc. are not annotated as
discourse markers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that not all words and phrases that <em>can</em> serve as
discourse markers actually do so under all circumstances: Some tokens
can also serve other functions, e.g., <em>for</em> can be a causal
discourse marker (and then, be substituted with <em>because</em>), but
it can also serve as a preposition indicating the beneficiary of an
action. Likewise, discourse markers that serve to connect parts of the
same utterance are beyond the scope of AURIS. Such expressions are not
annotated as discourse connectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the current workflow, the first candidate discourse marker is
automatically annotated. However, note that this has been heuristically
extracted and may include discourse markers not modifying the main
predicate, or expressions that <em>could</em> serve as discourse markers
but that don’t in this particular context. Thus, in the column
<code>MARKER</code>, these are always shown with a question mark and to
be confirmed (or replaced) by manual annotation. Discourse markers with
question marks are considered an error.</p>
<h3 id="a.4.2-annotation-of-implicit-discourse-markers">A.4.2 Annotation
of implicit discourse markers</h3>
<p>If an utterance does not feature an explicit discourse marker,
annotators should try to test whether an explicit discourse marker could
be inserted or whether another discourse relations applies. Example (14)
shows an example of an implicit <em>because</em> inserted to connect two
adjacent utterances</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="14" type="1">
<li><em>Some have raised their cash positions to record levels.
<strong>[Implicit = because]</strong> High cash positions help buffer a
fund when the market falls.</em> (PDTB2, 0983)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>In discourse relations with implicit discourse markers, the anchor
always precedes the utterance. In the following, it would be logically
possible to annotate Reason to point from the first utterance to the
second, but because of ordering preferences for implicit relations, we
only annotate the inverse relation Result:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Carl is crazy. <strong>[Implicit = this is why]</strong> he beats
his wife. (Prasad and Bunt 2015, punctuation adjusted)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>For annotating implicit discourse markers, annotators should use the
list of discourse relations and their diagnostic discourse markers, and
check it the order specified in Sect. <strong>BELOW</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>check whether the preceding sentence could be an anchor
<ol type="1">
<li>by inserting the first discourse marker on the list, if that
fails</li>
<li>by inserting the second discourse marker, etc.</li>
<li>if both utterances are connected by a coherence relation between two
referring expressions, insert no marker, but annotate EntRel</li>
</ol></li>
<li>if no discourse marker could be inserted, test the preceding
utterance
<ol type="1">
<li>using the same procedure</li>
</ol></li>
<li>iterate until an anchor and an implicit discourse marker have been
found or no possible anchor can be expected anymore (e.g., because the
text deals with different topics)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Unlike PDTB2, the annotation of implicit relations is not
limited to adjacent utterances.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a.4.3-alternative-lexicalizations">A.4.3 Alternative
Lexicalizations</h3>
<p>Many researchers distinguish discourse markers and alternative
lexicalizations, i.e., a phrasal expression that conveys the meaning of
a discourse marker that could be used in its place in a more or less
equivalent way (e.g., <em>This observation leads us to conclude that
…</em> in place of <em>Thus, …</em>). If such phrases are no longer than
5 words, annotators should annotate such phrases as explicit discourse
markers. If such phrases are longer than 5 words, proceed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide a common discourse marker that could be used in place of the
alternative lexicalization, write the alternative lexicalization and put
the discourse marker in <strong>square brackets</strong>
afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the discourse marker you provided could also be used <em>in
addition to</em> the alternative lexicalization, then treat this as
implicit discourse marker, i.e.,</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the discourse marker you inferred in round brackets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a.5-relation-inventory">A.5 Relation Inventory</h2>
<p>AURIS discourse relations are organized in a hierarchy that is also
used to define selection preferences for annotation.</p>
<h3 id="a.5.1-top-level-organization">A.5.1 Top-Level Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADVERSATIVITY</strong>: discourse relations concerned with
highlighting prominent differences between the situations presented in
utterance and anchor.</li>
<li><strong>CONTINGENCY</strong>: discourse relations in which one of
the situations described in utterance and anchor causally influences the
other, i.e., it provides a reason, explanation or justification in the
other situation.</li>
<li><strong>TEMPORAL</strong>: the situations described in utterance and
anchor are related temporally.</li>
<li><strong>EXPANSION</strong>: other relations which expand the
discourse and move its narrative or exposition forward.</li>
<li><strong>DIALOG</strong>: discourse relations for turn-taking in
dialog.</li>
<li><strong>EntRel</strong>: utterance and anchor are not related by any
of the other types of discourse relations, but indirectly by addressing
the same entities</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these, we use <strong>NoRel</strong> to mark
utterances for which no anchor can be established.</p>
<h3 id="a.5.2-annotation-principles">A.5.2 Annotation Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>if the main predicate carries more than one explicit discourse
marker, annotate the first explicit discourse marker</p></li>
<li><p>if there is no discourse marker or the discourse marker is
ambiguous with respect to the discourse relation it encodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>annotate the most specific discourse relation possible, using the
following preference hierachy</p>
<ul>
<li>ADVERSATIVITY &gt; CONTINGENCY &gt; TEMPORAL &gt; EXPANSION &gt;
DIALOG &gt; EntRel &gt; NoRel</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The logic behind this ranking is that it describes a spectrum from
semantically highly constrained (i.e., very specific) to semantically
less constrained (i.e., more generic) relation types, and that
annotators should annotate the most specific discourse relation
applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>adversative relations can involve a causal element (especially
CONCESSION), so that these are considered more specific than causal</li>
<li>causal (CONTINGENCY) relations imply a temporal element (cause
precedes or overlaps with result), so that these are more specific than
temporal</li>
<li>as a means of driving the discourse forward, TEMPORAL relations are
a subset of expansion relations</li>
<li>In general, dialog acts apply to all utterances, but in the context
of discourse annotations, they should be limited to cases in which no
other discourse relations apply. So, their annotation priority is below
that of Expansion. Nevertheless, if over signals require a functional
dependence or feedback dependence annotation, these should be used.</li>
<li>we follow the view of PDTB that entity relations should be annotated
only if no other relation applies. <code>EntRel</code> relations are a
fallback to enable the annotation of discourse relations whose
attachment is unclear, but still evident from coreference links.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no relation can be established with the last preceding utterance,
explore the one before, etc. Note that, as a result, the anchor of an
utterance does not have to be in the preceding utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li>(16.1) <em>Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.&nbsp;is trying to struggle
back.</em></li>
<li>(16.2) [ANCHOR:] <em>Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old
securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown, racked by
internal squabbles and defections.</em></li>
<li>(16.3) <em>Its relationship with parent General Electric Co.&nbsp;had
been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years
ago.</em></li>

<li>(16.5) <em><strong>[Implicit Contrast = But]</strong> Now, the firm
says it’s at a turning point.</em></li>
<li>(16.6) “By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart
– the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as
a”tool-and-die man” when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 –
retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home, possibly to build a shopping
mall on some land he owns.”” (Prasad et al.&nbsp;2017, p.&nbsp;10)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the anchor of the implicit Contrast (16.5) is three
sentences back (16.2).</p>
<ul>
<li>(17.1) [ANCHOR:] P1: <em>Is it safe to put my camera through
here?</em></li>
<li>(17.2) P1: <em>It’s a very expensive camera you know.</em></li>
<li>(17.3) <strong>[Answer]</strong> P2: <em>Yes, that’s perfectly
safe.</em> (Bunt and Prasad 2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>For (17.3), no discourse relation, nor an entity relation can be
established between with (17.2), so that (17.1) has to be considered
(and can be confirmed) as anchor.</p>
<ul>
<li>(18.1) [ANCHOR:] A: <em>So I can be there at 10:30.</em></li>
<li>(18.2) A: <em>I don’t know about Peterson.</em></li>
<li>(18.3) <strong>[Feedback]</strong> B: <em>10:30, okay.</em></li>
<li>(18.4) B: <em>We’ll start at 10:15 with the formalities.</em> (Bunt
et al.&nbsp;2012, p.433)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an utterance can take more than one sentence as anchor, annotate
the most proximate anchor, only:</p>
<ul>
<li>(19.1) B: <em>We’re gonna be selling this remote control for twenty
five euro</em></li>
<li>(19.2) B: <em>and we’re aiming to make fifty million euro</em></li>
<li>(19.3) B: <em>so we’re gonna be selling this on an international
scale</em></li>
<li>(19.4) [ANCHOR:] B: <em>and we don’t want it to cost more than
twelve fifty euros</em></li>
<li>(19.5) <strong>[Feedback]</strong> D: <em>Okay</em></li>
<li>(19.6) [ANCHOR:] B: <em>So fifty percent of the selling
price</em></li>
<li>(19.7) <strong>[Feedback]</strong> D: <em>Can we go over that
again</em> (Bunt et al., 2012, p.432-433)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Bunt et al.&nbsp;(2012), (19.5) actually refers back to
(19.1) - (19.4), but we annotate only (19.4) as anchor. (19.7), then,
takes scope over (19.1) - (19.4) <em>and</em> (19.6), but we only
annotate the relation to (19.6).</p>

relation possible.</p>
<h3 id="adversatory"><code>ADVERSATORY</code></h3>
<p>Discourse relations concerned with highlighting differences between
the situations described in the utterance and the anchor.</p>
<h4 id="concession"><code>Concession</code></h4>
<p><code>Concession</code> is used when an causal relation expected from
one of the arguments is cancelled or denied by the situation described
in the other. Concession is related to CONTRAST in that it highlights a
difference between utterance and anchor. Semantically, the connective
indicates that one of the sentences describes a situation A which causes
C, while the other asserts (or implies) ¬C. Alternatively, one sentences
denotes a fact that triggers a set of potential consequences, while the
other denies one or more of them (cf.&nbsp;Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016, Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.32,34; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.24). Diagnostic discourse
markers (either at the <code>expectation-raiser</code> or the
<code>contra-expectation</code> argument) are <em>although</em> or
<em>even though</em>, a diagnostic discourse marker at
<code>contra-expectation</code> is <em>however</em>. Note that
<em>but</em>, taken as diagnostic discourse marker of
<code>Contrast</code> is usually also applicable to
<code>Concession</code>. Annotate <code>Concession</code> for cases in
which <code>however</code> can be used in place of <code>but</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that concessive connectives can also be used in a rhetorical or
pragmatic way where their semantic conditions do not hold. Such cases of
“apparent Concession” are included here, as well, but MUST be documented
in comments. This includes cases in which the speech act associated with
the <code>expectation-raiser</code> is cancelled or denied by the
<code>contra-expectation</code> or its speech act. So far, this has been
observed for <code>contra-expectation</code>, only (Webber et al., 2019,
p.24, PDTB3 Comparison.Concession+SpeechAct).</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="expectation-raiser"><code>expectation-raiser</code></h5>
<p>The utterance creates an expectation (a situation that is expected to
cause the situation described in the other argument) that is cancelled
or denied by the anchor. The main diagnostic discourse marker is
<em>although</em> (PDTB “expectation”, Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.34, Webber
et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.23-24, Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016).</p>

<h5 id="contra-expectation"><code>contra-expectation</code></h5>
<p>The utterance cancels or denies a situation that is expected after
processing the anchor (cf.&nbsp;Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.34). A diagnostic
discourse marker <em>however</em>.</p>

<li><p>(21.1) <em>Last Friday, 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new

Mr.&nbsp;Wathen says. <strong>[Implicit=however]</strong> “Their approach

</ul>
<p><code>Contra-expectation</code> also applies to cases in which
concessive connectives are used in a rhetorical or pragmatic way where
their semantic conditions do not hold (cf.&nbsp;Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.&nbsp;27).
Such cases of “apparent Concession” MUST be documented in comments.</p>
<h5 id="concession-1"><code>concession</code></h5>
<p>Annotate utterances whose discourse relation is ambiguous between
“expectation” and “contra-expectation”, or where the context or the
annotators’ world knowledge is not sufficient to specify the subtype as
<code>concession</code> (Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.34).</p>

</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contrast"><code>Contrast</code></h3>
<p>In <code>Contrast</code>, the utterance and the anchor share a
predicate or property and a difference is highlighted with respect to
the values assigned to the shared property. The truth of both arguments
is independent of the connective or the established relation, i.e.,
neither argument describes a situation that is asserted on the basis of
the other one, and thus, there is no directionality in the
interpretation of the arguments (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016, Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.32). This is the main difference in comparison with the
otherwise similar <code>Concession</code> relation. A diagnostic
discourse marker for contrast is <em>but</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(23.1) Operating revenue rose 69% to A$8.48 billion from A$5.01

<li>(23.2) Mr.&nbsp;Edelman said the decision ”has nothing to do with Marty
Ackerman.” <strong>[implicit=on the contrary]</strong> Mr.&nbsp;Ackerman

of Datapoint. (PDTB3, wsj 0333)</li>
<li>(23.3) The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office stressed criminal cases

<strong>But</strong> the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16. (Prasad
et al.&nbsp;2017, p.8)</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes cases of juxtaposition, in which the connective
indicates that the values assigned to some shared property are taken to
be alternatives as in (23.4).</p>
<ul>
<li>(23.4) <em>After all, gold prices usually soar when inflation is
high. Utility stocks, <strong>on the other hand</strong>, thrive on
disinflation …</em> (PDTB3, wsj 0359)</li>
</ul>
<p>This also includes cases of opposition, in which the connective
indicates that the values assigned to some shared property are the
extremes of a gradable scale, e.g., <em>tall-short</em>,
<em>accept-reject</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Note that explicit discourse markers can also be used to underline a
“pragmatic” contrast relation that does not hold between utterance and
anchor, but between one of the arguments and an inference that can be
drawn from the other, in many cases at the speech act level, as in
(23.6).</p>
<ul>
<li>(23.5) <em>“It’s just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some

they’re now creating wines that appeal to these people.” That explains

<blockquote>
<p>If annotators face difficulties to distinguish
<code>Concession</code> and <code>Contrast</code>, check by paraphrasing
with <em>although</em> or <em>however</em>, whether a causal relation
that is expected on the basis of one argument is denied by the other. If
this is possible, annotate <code>Concession</code>, if not, annotate
<code>Contrast</code>.</p>

<h3 id="contingency">CONTINGENCY</h3>
<h4 id="causal">Causal</h4>
<p>In a <code>Causal</code> relation, one argument (<code>reason</code>)
provides a reason, explanation or justification for the situation
(<code>result</code>) described in other to come about or occur (cf.&nbsp;ISO

<h5 id="reason"><code>reason</code></h5>
<p>The utterance prodives the reason (cause, explanation or
justification) for the situation described in the anchor, as typically
expressed with the connective <em>because</em> (cf.&nbsp;PDTB2 Reason, Prasad

<ul>
<li>(24.1) <em>Some have raised their cash positions to record levels.
<strong>[Implicit: Because]</strong> High cash positions help buffer a
fund when the market falls.</em> (Prasad and Bunt 2015)</li>
<li>(24.2) <em>But a strong level of investor withdrawal is much more
unlikely this time around, fund managers said. <strong>A major reason is
that</strong> investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases
of stock funds since Black Monday.</em> (Prasad and Bunt 2015)</li>
<li>(24.3) <em>But service on the line is expected to resume by noon

because</strong> Congress and the administration have failed to reach
agreement on a deficit-cutting bill.</em> (PDTB3, wsj 2384)</li>
<li>(24.5) P1: <em>I can never find my remote control.</em> P2:
<em>That’s <strong>because</strong> they don’t have a fixed place.</em>
(Bunt and Prasad 2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in (24.5), we do not annotate a <code>DIALOG</code>
relation because an overt discourse markers indicates a higher-ranking
discourse relation.</p>
<p>The <code>reason</code> relation also includes epistemic, rhetorical
or pragmatic uses of causal connectives, e.g., where the utterance
provides justification for a claim expressed in the anchor, as marked,
for example, with the connective <em>because</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(24.6) Mrs Yeargin is lying. <strong>[Implicit = because]</strong>
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she
gave them similar help. (PDTB2, 0044)</li>
<li>(24.7) And until last Friday, it seemed those efforts were starting
to pay off. <strong>[Implicit=because]</strong> “Some of those folks

Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc.&nbsp;(PDTB3, wsj 1866)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="result"><code>result</code></h5>
<p>The situation described in the utterance is interpreted as the result
(effect) of the situation presented in the anchor. A diagnostic
discourse marker is <em>as a result</em> (cf.&nbsp;PDTB Result, Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.26,29; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.20).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(25.1) <em>Now, though, enormous costs for earthquake relief will
pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief. “<strong>That
obviously means that</strong> we won’t have enough for all of the
emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider

(PDTB3, wsj 1824; Prasad and Bunt 2015)</p></li>
<li><p>(25.2) <em>“We are going to explode lower,” says the flamboyant
market seer, . . . <strong>[Implicit=so]</strong> Anyone telling you to

0359)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relation <code>result</code> also applies to episthemic uses of
causal markers, when the anchor gives the evidence justifying the claim
given in the utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li>(25.3) <em>There were no sell lists and the calendar is lightening
up a bit. <strong>[Implicit=so]</strong> There’s light at the end of the
tunnel for municipalities.</em> (PDTB3, wsj 0351)</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, <code>result</code> is to be used when the anchor is the
reason for the speaker to produce the (speech act represented by the)
utterance:</p>
<ul>
<li>(25.4) <em>Surviving scandal has become a rite of political passage
at a time when a glut of scandal has blunted this town’s sensibility.
<strong>[implicit=so]</strong> Let the president demand strict new
ethics rules.</em> (PDTB3, wsj 0909)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: PDTB3 introduced Cause/negative-result for intrasentential
relations, specifically for the English construction <em>too X to Y</em>
(Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.18,20). This does not seem to be relevant for
intersentential relations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="cause"><code>cause</code></h5>
<p>For causal relations between utterance and anchor, annotators should
normally apply <code>reason</code> or <code>result</code>. Only if the
annotators could not uniquely specify the directionality, they should
use <code>cause</code>, instead.</p>
<h4 id="conditional"><code>Conditional</code></h4>
<p>A <code>Conditional</code> relation relates a hypothetical
(unrealized) scenario with its (possible) consequence. The consequence
is a situation that holds when the condition is true. Unlike
<code>Causal</code> relations, the truth value of the arguments of a
<code>Conditional</code> relation cannot be determined independently of
the connective. (PDTB Condition, Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.26,29; SemAF
CONDITION).</p>
<h5 id="condition"><code>condition</code></h5>
<p>The utterance represents a <code>condition</code>, an unrealized
situation which, when realized, would lead to the consequence described
in the anchor. If the utterance holds true, the anchor is caused to hold
true at some instant in all possible futures. This can be a generic
truth about the world, a statement that describes a regular outcome
every time the condition holds true, or a single time that this is the
case. Following ISO 24617-8, this is independent of whether the
<code>consequence</code> is believed to be true (factuals) or not
(counterfactuals). If the condition is not true, the anchor should
express what the consequences would had been if it had (Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.30-31; Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016). A diagnostic discourse
marker is <em>if</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(26.1) <em>“Orange County is taking in at least $4 billion
nationwide by boiler rooms every year”, Mr.&nbsp;McClelland says.
“<strong>Because</strong> I’ve heard that there is $40 billion in total,
and that’s 10%.”</em> (reformulated after PDTB2, 1568)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Condition</code> also includes rhetorical or pragmatic uses of
conditional constructions whose interpretation deviates from the
standard semantics, e.g., cases of explicit <em>if</em> tokens where
utterance and anchor are not causally related, but presented as if they
were. In these cases, the anchor holds true independently of the anchor,
there is no causal relation between the two arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>relevant context information</em>: The utterance provides the
context in which the description of the situation in anchor is relevant.
A frequently cited example for this type of conditional is (113). (To be
replaced by an intersentential relation.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(26.2) * <strong>If</strong> you are thirsty, there’s beer in the
fridge.* (constructed, INTRASENTENTIAL)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>implicit assertion</em>: refers to a special use of
<em>if</em>-constructions when the conditional involves an (implicit)
assertion. In (26.3), the utterance (<em>O’ Connor is your man</em>) is
not a consequent state that will result if the condition expressed in
the anchor holds true. Instead, <em>if</em> is used to implicitly assert
that O’Connor will keep the crime rates high. (To be replaced by an
intersentential relation.)</p>
<ul>
<li>(26.3) <em>In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank
O’Connor, GOP Gov.&nbsp;Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person
saying, “<strong>If</strong> you want to keep the crime rates high,
O’Connor is your man.”</em> (PDTB2, 0041)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="consequence"><code>consequence</code></h5>
<p>The anchor represents a condition, i.e., an unrealized situation
which, when realized, would lead to the <code>consequence</code>
described in the utterance. As for the logical relation between
condition and consequence, the same conditions hold as described above
(cf.&nbsp;Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016). A diagnostic paraphrase is <em>under this
condition</em>, possible discourse markers are <em>then</em> and
<em>so</em> (which can also be used for temporal and causal
relations).</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="27" type="1">
<li><em>“I’ve heard that there is $40 billion taken in nationwide by
boiler rooms every year,” Mr.&nbsp;McClelland says. “<strong>If that’s true

(PDTB2, 1568)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="negative-condition"><code>Negative Condition</code></h4>
<p>One sentence represents an unrealized situation (negated condition)
which, if it does <strong>not</strong> occur, would lead to the
consequent described in the other (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; Webber et
al.&nbsp;2019a, p.23).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible that this is not an
intersentential relation. In PDTB2, <em>unless</em> would normally be
annotated as EXPANSION/Alternative/disjunctive, but Bunt and Prasad
(2016) explicitly link it with PDTB2 Condition, instead. PDTB3
introduced CONTINGENCY/Negative Condition for intrasentential relations
(Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.18).</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="neg_condition"><code>neg_condition</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes an unrealized situation which, when not
realized, leads to the <code>Consequence</code> described in the anchor.
A diagnostic discourse marker is <em>unless</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(28.1) <em>But a Soviet bank here would be crippled
<strong>unless</strong> Moscow found a way to settle the $188 million
debt, which was lent to the country’s short-lived democratic Kerensky
government before the Communists seized power in 1917.</em> (Webber et
al.&nbsp;2019a, p.23, INTRASENTENTIAL)</p></li>
<li><p>(28.2) <em>Sandoz said it expects a ”substantial increase” in
consolidated profit for the full year, <strong>barring</strong> major
currency rate change.</em> (PDTB3, wsj 2089, INTRASENTENTIAL)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This also includes episthemic uses of conditional discourse markers,
esp., when the consequent is an implicit speech act.</p>
<ul>
<li>(28.3) * <strong>Unless</strong> you’re on a diet, there are some
cookies in the cupboard.* (Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.23)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="neg_consequence"><code>neg_consequence</code></h5>
<p>The anchor describes an unrealized situation which, when not
realized, leads to the negative consequence described by the utterance.
A diagnostic discourse marker is <em>otherwise</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="29" type="1">
<li><em>This will prevent a slide in industrial production, which will
<strong>otherwise</strong> cause new panic buying.</em> (PDTB3, wsj
1646, INTRASENTENTIAL)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="purpose"><code>Purpose</code></h4>
<p>In a <code>Purpose</code> relation, the <code>goal</code> enables the
<code>enablement</code>, i.e., one sentence presents an action that an
AGENT undertakes with the purpose of the GOAL conveyed by the other
sentence being achieved. Usually (but not always), the agent undertaking
the action is the same agent aiming to achieve the goal (Bunt &amp;
Prasad 2016; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.21). This relation is similar to
<code>Causal</code> and <code>Conditional</code> relations, the main
difference is that the former are neutral with respect to individual
engagement whereas <code>Purpose</code> relations presume some level of
agency on behalf of the speaker, the hearer or another agent addressed
or involved in the situation described. <code>Purpose</code> requires a
volitional agent, a diagnostic marker for the <code>goal</code> role is
<em>in order to</em>, a diagnostic marker for the
<code>enablement</code> is <em>for that purpose</em> (Webber et
al.&nbsp;2019b).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In PDTB2, purpose seems to have been grouped
together with Cause and Condition. PDTB3 introduced Purpose specifically
for intrasentential relations (Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.18). It is thus
possible that it does not apply to intersentential relations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="goal"><code>goal</code></h5>
<p>The utterance represents a goal (purpose) enabled by the situation
described in the anchor, i.e., the action undertaken to achieve the goal
(Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.21). All PDTB3 examples are intrasentential.
This is possibly not relevant for AURIS.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h5 id="enablement"><code>enablement</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes a situation that enables the goal (purpose)
described in the anchor, i.e., the action undertaken to achieve the goal
(Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.21). A diagnostic marger is <em>for that
purpose</em>.</p>

</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="temporal"><code>TEMPORAL</code></h3>
<h4 id="synchrony"><code>Synchrony</code></h4>
<p><code>Synchrony</code> applies if the situations described in the
utterance and the anchor have some degree of temporal overlap, i.e., if
the two situations started and ended at the same time, if one was
temporally embedded in the other, or if the two crossed. Diagnostic
connectives are <em>while</em> and <em>when</em> (Bunt &amp; Prasad
2016; PDTB2 Synchronuous in Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.27-28).</p>
<ul>
<li>(32.1) <em>Then, in late-afternoon trading, hundred-thousand-share

</ul>
<h4 id="asynchrony">Asynchrony</h4>
<p>The utterance stands in a temporal order with the situation described
in the anchor (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016, Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.27).</p>
<h5 id="before"><code>before</code></h5>
<p>The situation described in the utterance temporally precedes the
situation described in the anchor. A diagnostic discourse marker is
<em>before (that)</em> (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007,
p.28).</p>
<ul>
<li>(33.1) <em>John D. Carney, 45, was named to succeed Mr.&nbsp;Hatch as

Webber et al.&nbsp;2019b)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="after"><code>after</code></h5>
<p>The situation described in the anchor temporally precedes the
situation described in the utterance (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.28). Diagnostic discourse markers are <em>after (that)</em>
and <em>then</em> (temporal).</p>
<ul>
<li>(34.1) <em>A buffet breakfast was held in the museum, where food and

</ul>
<h3 id="expansion"><code>EXPANSION</code></h3>
<h4 id="conjunction"><code>Conjunction</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Conjunction</code>, utterance and anchor feature the same
relation to some other situation evoked in the discourse. As an example,
this includes a list, defined in prior discourse, where
<code>Conjunction</code> is the relation between the list elements. A
discourse marker for conjunction indicates that utterance and anchor, or
the entities mentioned therein are doing the same thing with respect to
that situation (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016). The situation described in the
utterance provides additional, discourse new, information that is
related to the situation described in the anchor, but not in any other,
more specific discourse relation. The semantics are thus no more than
that of a logical ∧ (and). Diagnostic connectives are <em>also</em>,
<em>in addition</em>, <em>additionally</em>, <em>further</em>, etc.
(Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.37; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.25-26). A frequent
discourse marker is also <em>and</em>, but note that this is ambiguous
between this and other discourse relations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Because of the largely underspecified
semantics, this must be annotated after any more specific relation has
been tested for.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(35.1) <em>Food prices are expected to be unchanged, but energy

</ul>
<h4 id="disjunction"><code>Disjunction</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Disjunction</code>, utterance and anchor denote alternative
situations that bear the same relation to some other situation evoked in
the discourse and that make a similar contribution with respect to that
third situation (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; Prasad et al.&nbsp;2007, p.36;
Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.26). We do not distinguish as to whether both
situations can hold simultaneously (logical or) or they are mutually
exclusive (exclusive or). A diagnostic discourse marker is
<em>or</em>.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="restatement"><code>Restatement</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Restatement</code>, the utterance describes the same
situation as the anchor, but from a different perspective, e.g., when
describing the same situation as presented before using the speaker’s
own words (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; PDTB2 Restatement/equivalence, Prasad
et al.&nbsp;2007, p.35-36, Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.26). A diagnostic discourse
marker is <em>in other words</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(37.1) <em>Chairman Krebs says the California pension fund is

p.486)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="exception"><code>Exception</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Exception</code>, the <code>regular</code> evokes a set of
circumstances in which the described situation holds, while the
<code>exception</code> indicates one or more instances where it doesn’t
(Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.27).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Intutitively, this involves an element of contrast, but we
follow PDTB2 in considering it a form of PDTB EXPANSION.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="regular"><code>regular</code></h5>
<p>The utterance evokes a set of circumstances in which the described
situation holds, while the anchor represents an exception, i.e., it
indicates one or more instances where it doesn’t (Bunt &amp; Prasad

</ol></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is yet to be confirmed whether this

<h5 id="exception-1"><code>exception</code></h5>
<p>The utterances specifies an exception to the generalization specified

false because the sitation described in the utterance is true (but if
the utterance were false, the anchor would be true), cf.&nbsp;(Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.36). According to PDTB2, possible discourse markers are
<em>instead</em> or <em>rather</em> – both of these are, however, more
regularly used with other discourse relations, so that they are not
diagnostic discourse markers.</p>

<h4 id="exemplification"><code>Exemplification</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Exemplification</code>, one sentence describes a set of
situations; the other an element of that set (Bunt &amp; Prasad
2016).</p>
<h5 id="set"><code>set</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes a situation as holding in a set of

include <em>(more) generally</em> or <em>in general</em>:</p>

<h5 id="instance"><code>instance</code></h5>
<p>The utterance provides one or more instances of the circumstances
described by the anchor. The anchor evokes a set and the utterance
describes it in further detail. It may be a set of events, a set of
reasons, or a generic set of events, behaviors, attitudes, etc.
Diagnostic discourse markes are <em>for example</em>, <em>for
instance</em>, <em>in particular</em> and <em>specifically</em> (Prasad

al.&nbsp;2019a, p.27).</p>
<h5 id="broad"><code>broad</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes the same situation as the anchor, but the
anchor provides more detail. Typically, the utterance summarizes the
anchor, or in some cases expresses a conclusion or generalization (Bunt
&amp; Prasad 2016; PDTB2 Restatement/generalization in Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.35). Diagnostic discourse markers include <em>in sum</em>,
<em>in short</em>, <em>overall</em>, and <em>finally</em>.</p>

</ul>
<h5 id="specific"><code>specific</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes the situation described in the anchor in more
detail. Diagnostic discourse markers include <em>specifically</em>,

al.&nbsp;2017, p.&nbsp;12)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="manner"><code>Manner</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Manner</code>, the <code>means</code> argument describes a
way in which the <code>achievement</code> comes about or occurs (Bunt
&amp; Prasad 2016). Manner answers “how” questions such as “How were the
children playing?” (Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.28).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As PDTB3 introduced Manner specifically for
intrasentential relations, it is yet to be confirmed whether this is a
relevant category for AURIS. Also note that Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a (p.28)
emphasized that manner is typically accompanied by other relations
(Purpose, Result or Condition).</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="means"><code>means</code></h5>
<p>The utterance describes the means, i.a. a way in which the
achievement presented in the anchor comes about or occurs (Bunt &amp;
Prasad 2016). For intrasentential manner relations, a diagnostic
discourse marker is <em>by</em>, a diagnostic paraphrase is <em>the
manner of/in which/by which</em> (Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.29-30).</p>
<ul>
<li>(44.1) <em>Taking a cue from California, more politicians will

</ul>
<h5 id="achievement"><code>achievement</code></h5>
<p>The anchor describes a way in which the achievement described in the
utterance comes about or occurs (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016). A diagnostic
discourse marker is <em>thereby</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(45.1) <em>McCaw is offering $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares,

0293)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="substitution"><code>Substitution</code></h4>
<p>Two mutually exclusive alternatives are evoked in the discourse but
only one is taken, the other is ruled out. A diagnostic discourse marker
is the connective <em>instead</em> (PDTB2 chosen alternative, Prasad et
al.&nbsp;2007, p.36; Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.29-30). To some extent, the same
discourse markers can be used for <code>Substitution</code> and
<code>Exception</code>, the difference is that <code>Exception</code> is
an observation and grounded in facts, whereas <code>Substitution</code>
involves a conscious choice or preference.</p>
<h5 id="disfavoured-alternative"><code>disfavoured-alternative</code></h5>
<p>In comparison with the favoured alternative presented in the anchor,
the situation described in the utterance is disfavored or rejected
alternative (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016). A diagnostic discourse marker is
the connective <em>rather than</em>.</p>

<p>In comparison with the disfavoured alternative presented in the
anchor, the situation described in the utterance is favored, and the
alternative presented in the anchor is rules out (Bunt &amp; Prasad
2016, Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.30). A diagnostic discourse marker is the
connective <em>rather</em>.</p>

<p>In <code>Similarity</code>, one or more similarities between the
utterance and the anchor are highlighted with respect to what each
predicates as a whole or to some entities they mention (Bunt &amp;

</blockquote>
<h5 id="hypophora"><code>Hypophora</code></h5>
<p>Hypophora is used when the utterance represents an answer to a
rhetorical question presented in the anchor. If there is a semantic
discourse relation connecting the situation described with another
anchor in the discourse, annotate this as the relation of the question
(the anchor of <code>Hypophora</code>). The diagnostic criterion is that
the anchor has the form of a question, that the answer is immediately
provided by the speaker and that no answer from the addressee is
expected.</p>
<ul>

waters. (PDTB3, wsj 0100)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="attribution"><code>Attribution</code></h5>
<p>We do not consider attribution a discourse relation in its own right.
However, as we perform sentence-level annotation over pre-determined
sentence splits, it is possible that an attribution phrase gets detached
from the reported statement. In those cases, annotate the utterance
expressing the attribution with an <code>Attribution</code> relation
that takes the statement (resp., its closest sentence) as anchor:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="49" type="1">
<li><strong>[Attribution]</strong> Now, let’s read what He said in
Matthew 6:9-10: [Anchor] After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father
which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
(https://kcmcanada.ca/04-2021-partner-letter/, accessed 2023-11-16)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that example (49) originally had a <em>paragraph break</em>
between the attribution sentence and the statement.</p>
<h3 id="dialog"><code>DIALOG</code></h3>
<p>Dialog relations are to be annotated if and only if turn-taking
between multiple speakers applies and no other discourse relation is
explicitly signalled. In this case, annotate the discourse function.</p>
<p>We follow ISO 24617-8 (Bunt et al.&nbsp;2012, p.431; Bunt et al.&nbsp;2019) in
distinguishing two kinds of turn-taking relations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>functional dependence applies to response actions, where the anchor
represents an invitation to provide a response such as represented by
the utterance. This includes the relation between an answer and the
question (that it answers), or the acceptance of an apology and the
apology (which is accepted).</li>
<li>feedback dependence applies to utterances of the speaker that
respond to utterances of the addressee but that are not explicitly
called for by the addresse. This includes feedback utterances like
“sure”, “no way”, or a head nod (anchor is the utterance that the
feedback is about), or clarification questions (anchor is an utterance
that the speaker is eliciting information about).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: AURIS dialog relations are only to be
annotated if they occur after turn-taking and no other discourse
relation applies. Dialog relations do not apply when the subsequent text
relates to a question in other ways – for example, in the case of
rhetorical questions that are posed for dramatic effect or to make an
assertion, rather than to elicit an answer (Webber et al.&nbsp;2019a, p.9).
Rhetorical questions are excluded from this group and to be annoted as
<code>Hypophora</code>, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="functional-dependence"><code>Functional dependence</code></h4>
<p>In <code>Functional dependence</code>, the utterance is a dialogue
act that is responsive in nature and that address the information
communicated in the utterances; the anchor is the dialogue act that the
utterance responds to (Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016, Bunt et al.&nbsp;2019).
Diagostic paraphrases include (semantically empty) responses such as
“Yes”, “No thanks”, “No problem”, and “OK” (Bunt et al.&nbsp;2012, p.432). In
AURIS, functional dependence relations involve the explicit elicitation
of the response as an anchor – either directly by a question, request or
suggestion, or indirectly with a statement that the addressee reacts
to.</p>
<p>Following ISO (2010; cf.&nbsp;Bunt et al.&nbsp;2018, 2019), the following
communicative functions are relevant and should be annotated in AURIS as
sub-types of functional dependence: <code>Answer</code>,
<code>Offer</code>, <code>Address Suggest</code>,
<code>Agreement</code>, <code>Disagreement</code></p>
<h6 id="answer"><code>answer</code></h6>
<p>The utterance is a dialog act performed by the speaker in order to
make the information in the utterance known to the addressee in response
to the anchor. The anchor expresses an information-seeking function
(e.g., a question). The speaker believes the utterance to be correct
(ISO 2010, Bunt et al.&nbsp;2018, 2019). If an answer involves feedback
particles like <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em> or <em>perhaps</em>, these
should be annotated as explicit discourse marker. Do not annotate an
implicit discourse marker.</p>
<ul>
<li>(50.1) S: <em>“what does the display say?”</em> H:
<strong>[Implicit: answer]</strong> <em>“send error document ready”</em>
(DIAMOND corpus, ISO 2010)</li>
<li>(50.2) A: <em>Is there an earlier connection?</em> B: *
<strong>No</strong>, I’m sorry, there isn’t.* (Bunt et al.&nbsp;2012,
p.432)</li>
<li>(50.3) P1: <em>Is it safe to put my camera through here? It’s a very
expensive camera you know.</em> P2: * <strong>Yes</strong>, that’s
perfectly safe.* (Bunt and Prasad 2016)</li>
<li>(50.4) <em>So, are you satisfied? <strong>Yes</strong>, we are</em>.
(Żurowski et al.&nbsp;2023, p.487)</li>
<li>(50.5) A: <em>What newspapers do you read?</em> <strong>[Implicit:
answer]</strong> B: <em>I read uh the local newspaper, and I also try
and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune, or the
New York Times or something like that</em> (Prasad and Bunt 2015)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not differentiate types of asnwers. However, note that we
distinguish answers that address an information need from responses to
requests for a particular action. Both can take questions as their
anchors, but a commitment (or denial) of future actions on behalf of the
speaker is to be annotated as <code>Offer</code>.</p>
<h6 id="agreement"><code>agreement</code></h6>
<p>The anchor describes a situation that the speaker presents as a true
statement. With the utterance, the addressee confirms that he believes
that this statement is indeed true (ISO 2010). Use if the utterance can
be paraphrased by “Exactly!”.</p>
<ul>
<li>(51.1) B: <em>I really like NPR a lot</em> A: <strong>Yeah</strong>
<em>that’s pretty good</em> (Prasad and Bunt 2015)</li>
<li>(51.2) <em>But our children are different. <strong>Yes</strong>,
they are different.</em> (Żurowski et al.&nbsp;2023, p.487)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>agreement</code> relation is similar to (a positive)
<code>answer</code> in that it addresses an information need of the
addressee, for the case of Agreement, however, it is not solicited by a
question, but by a speech act that invites a (positive) feedback
response.</p>
<h6 id="disagreement"><code>disagreement</code></h6>
<p>The anchor describes a situation that the speaker presents as a true
statement. With the utterance, the addresee informs the speaker that he
believes that this statement is false (ISO 2010).</p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="52" type="1">
<li>J: <em>“do you know where to find ink saving?”</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>S: <strong>[Answer]</strong> <em>“ehm.. oh I think to the left of
the ink cartridge”</em></li>
<li>J: <strong>[Disagreement]</strong> <em>“ehm…
<strong>no</strong>”</em> (DIAMOND corpus, ISO 2010)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>agreement</code> relation is similar to a negative
<code>answer</code> in that it addresses an information need of the
addressee, for the case of Agreement, however, it is not solicited by a
question, but by a speech act that is refuted by the speaker.</p>
<h6 id="offer"><code>offer</code></h6>
<p>With the utterance, the speaker commits himself to perform a
particular action. The speaker assumes that the addressee refers the
action to be performed. The anchor is the sentence that caused the
speaker to assume that the addressee wants him to perform the offered
activity (ISO 2010, Bunt et al.&nbsp;2018, 2019).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We only annotate <em>solicited</em> offers
that are performed in response to a request.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(53.1)
<ul>
<li>CAMOETO: <em>Nice runs! Are you running any supporting mods such as

<p>We do not differentiate different kinds of offers, such as promises
or accepting requests:</p>

<ul>
<li>SKubrick: <em>I’ve noticed the date ranges don’t update very
frequently and the percentages are different from what I’m calculating

<p>Offers also includes a <em>negative</em> response to requests (i.e.,
declined requests):</p>
<ul>
<li>(53.2)
<ol type="1">
<li>Unknown ID: <em>We’ll investigate it.</em></li>
<li>Unknown ID: <em>Is it possible for us to meet in person?</em></li>

accessed 2023-11-16)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>In Alibaba’s response, the first statement directly responds to the
preceding sentence, but is subsequently elaborated into a refined offer.
Note that this elaboration is to be modelled by <code>EXPANSION</code>
relations that take <em>Not now</em> as their anchor, not directly as
feedback responses to the statements of Unknown ID.</p>
<h6 id="address-suggest"><code>address-suggest</code></h6>
<p>With the utterance, the speaker commits himself (or declines) to
perform an action that was suggested to him. The anchor is an utterance
of the addressee that made the speaker believe that was a suggested
action. The main difference to <code>offer</code> is that the addressee
is neutral about his proposal or that the speaker himself is the main
beneficiary of the proposal (ISO 2010, Bunt et al.&nbsp;2018, 2019).</p>

</ul>
<p>We include both positive and negative responses to suggestions under
<code>address-suggest</code>.</p>
<h6 id="dependent-act"><code>dependent-act</code></h6>
<p>If an utterance dialog act is in response to the content of an
utterance by the addressee but none of the aforementioned communicative
functions applies, annotate as <code>dependent-act</code> and leave a
comment.</p>
<h4 id="feedback"><code>Feedback</code></h4>
<p>Feedback utterances are about the processing of a communicative event
that occured earlier in the discourse.</p>
<p>In a <code>Feedback</code> relation, the utterance provides or
elicits information about a communicative event (by one of the other
dialogue participants) that occurred earlier in the discourse. Feedback
expressions include <em>OK</em>, <em>Uh-huh</em>, <em>Really?</em>, but
also something like <em>Tuesday?</em> or <em>What did you say?</em> As
with Entity Relations, no explicit or implicit connective is identified
and annotated: The only elements of the relation are the utterance and
the anchor (Bunt et al.&nbsp;2012, Bunt &amp; Prasad 2016, Bunt et
al.&nbsp;2019).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The difference between feedback dependence and
functional dependence is that feedback dependence is not solicited by
the speaker. We do not distinguish communicative functions of feedback
relations. Another difference to functional dependence is that the
semantic content of a feedback act may be determined by what was said
before rather than by the semantic content of a previous dialogue
act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feedback includes phenomena such as clarification questions (55.1)
and confirmation of comprehension by direct responses (55.2) or
repetition (last line in 55.3), but not direct expressions of agreement
or disagreement.</p>
<ul>

then back up again</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="entrel-entity-relations"><code>EntRel</code>: Entity
relations</h3>
<p>If no other discourse relation can be annotated, but the utterance
stands in an entity-based coherence relation with the anchor (i.e.,
anchor and utterance contain referring expressions that stand in an
anphoric/coreferential relation with each other), then annotate an
entity relation (<code>EntRel</code>).</p>
<p>In an entity relation, the utterance provides further description
about some entity or entities introduced in the anchor, expanding the
narrative forward of which the anchor is a part, or expanding on the
setting relevant for interpreting the anchor. Utterance and anchor
describe distinct situations, and the anchor may seen as a “foreground”
that introduces the entities elaborated in the utterance (Bunt &amp;
Prasad 2016). Entity relations are not marked by explicit discourse
markers, but defined by coreference between their referrring
expressions, the anchor <em>must</em> always precede the utterance.</p>
<ul>
<li>(56.1) <em>She insisted that I go to college.
<strong>[EntRel]</strong> During the occupation, she put herself in
great danger to save me …</em> (Żurowski et al.&nbsp;2023, p.487)</li>
</ul>
<p>If an entity relation holds between the utterance and several
candidate anchors (as in ex. 56.2), annotate the relation to the closest
anchor candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>(56.2) HOLIDAY ADS: Seagram will run two interactive ads in December
magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and Crown Royal brands. The Chivas
ad illustrates – via a series of pullouts – the wild reactions from the
pool man, gardener and others if not given Chivas for Christmas. The
three-page Crown Royal ad features a black-and-white shot of a boring
holiday party – and a set of colorful stickers with which readers can
dress it up. <strong>[EntRel]</strong> Both ads were designed by
Omnicom’s DDB Needham agency. (PDTB2, 0989)</li>

<ul>
<li><p>pairwise discourse markers: Annotate independently. As both parts
refer to each other, this creates a cycle in the annotation.</p>
<ul>
<li>(57.1) <strong>On the one hand</strong>, Mr.&nbsp;Front says, it would be
misguided to sell into “a classic panic.” <strong>On the other
hand</strong>, it’s not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy.
(PDTB2, 2415)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>discourse markers of attribution verbs: If a discourse marker is
(correctly or not) attached to an attribution verb, but the main
predicate of an utterance is a dependent of the attribution verb, this
discourse marker is taken to refer to the main predicate. The primary
discourse marker is identified by means of the following
preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MAIN CLAUSE &gt; DEPENDENT CLAUSE &gt; DEPENDENT of DEPENDENT
CLAUSE</p></li>
<li><p>within a clause: first &gt; second</p></li>
<li><p>(57.1’) <strong>On the one hand</strong>, Mr.&nbsp;Front says, it
would be misguided to sell into “a classic panic.”</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Apparent cases of multiple utterance. In the following example,
utterances 4.-7. constitute an elaboration of 3. However, we adopt the
SDRT view on such constellations, that is, if 4 elaborates 3 and 5
elaborates 3, a narration relation hold between 4 and 5. Because we
annotate the closest anchor for each utterance, only the narration is to
be annotated, but not the elaboration. (Note that these are SDRT
relations, but the argumentation holds for ISO 24617-8 labels, as
well.)</p>
<p>(57.2) 1. Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a
symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular
case. 2. They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given
moment. 3. It has always been so. 4. <strong>[Implicit = for
example]</strong> In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes,
volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American
Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution
imposed by the Tennessee Legislature. 5. The result was a world-famous
trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the
“smart set,” whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken, and the religious
fundamentalists, whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives. 6. Few
now recall the actual outcome: 7. Scopes was convicted and fined $100,
and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive
under Tennessee law. (PDTB2, 0946)</p></li>
<li><p>multiple clauses as anchors: In AURIS, the anchor must be a
single utterance (resp., its main predicate). If a discourse connective
seems to take a <em>sequence</em> of utterances as anchors, chose the
closest candidate anchor with which a relation can be established.
However, plausibility overrides proximity. In the example below, the
third sentence <em>could</em> is in a contrast relation with the first
as well as the second. However, the second seems to elaborate with
anecdotal evidence on the first, so the main reason for surprisal in the
third utterance is not the karaoke ban, but the general poor condition.
So, annotate 1 as an anchor. (The situation may be different if karaoke
is the main topic of the article.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: This is different from PDTB, where, instead, a minimality
principle applies.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>attribution: As defined by Prasad et al.&nbsp;(2007, p.40),
attribution is “a relation of “ownership” between abstract objects and
individuals or agents. That is, attribution has to do with ascribing
beliefs and assertions expressed in text to the agent(s) holding or
making them”. If a the main clause of an utterance expresses an
attribution, with a statement in a dependent clause or direct speech
annotated as part of the same utterance, then the main predicate of the
utterance is to be taken from the statement, not the attribution verb.
If an utterance consists of an attribution verb only, without including
the reported statement, the main predicate is the attribution verb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: We rely on an existing pre-annotation for sentence (utterances)
here. If utterances are to be manually segmented, then attribution and
statement should be put in distinct utterances if and only if the
statement is a complete sentence. Normally, this occurs with direct
speech only. Also, reported statements interrupted by an attribution
verb should not be segmented, then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following example, the main predicate is “Judge O’Kicki
unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000”, although the syntactic
head is “says” (in the attribution clause “he says”). Note that this is
a relative clause. The attribution verb is likewise modified by a
temporal relative clause (“When … in June 1983”), but only amodifying
adverbial clause, not part of the attribution.</p>
<ul>
<li>(57.4) When Mr.&nbsp;Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation
case against the state in June 1983, he says [Judge O’Kicki unexpectedly
awarded him an additional $100,000]. (PDTB2, 0267)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If an utterance with attribution carries multiple relative
clauses, the comment should clarify which is considered the main
predicate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following example, the main predicate is the reported
statement in the first relative clause (“the 90-cent-an-hour rise … is
too small for the working poor”). In line with UD conventions, we
consider the coordinated main clause (“opponents argued …”) to be
subordinate to the first main clause.</p>
<ul>
<li>(57.5) <em>Advocates said</em> the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an
hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents
argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many
thousands of jobs. (PDTB2 0098)</li>
